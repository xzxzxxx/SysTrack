# SysTrack

SysTrack is a web-based data management application designed to replace Excel-based workflows with a robust PostgreSQL database. Built with a React frontend and Node.js backend, it offers a user-friendly interface for sales and account executive teams to manage clients and contracts efficiently. This project, developed as part of an internship, is designed to be maintainable and scalable for future developers, with plans for cloud deployment and database backups.

## Purpose

SysTrack aims to streamline client and contract management by providing a centralized, searchable, and sortable interface. It replaces manual Excel tracking with a database-driven solution, enabling teams to:

- Track client details (e.g., orders, renewals) and contract statuses.
- Automate contract code generation and enforce data integrity.
- Prepare for scalability with cloud hosting and regular backups.


## Features

- **Dashboard**: 
    - View total clients, contracts, and contracts expiring within 3 months.
- **Client Management**:
    - Add, edit, delete clients with simplified creation process (name and optional email only).
    - Auto-generated dedicated numbers (e.g., A01, A02) based on first letter of client name with fallback to 'X' for non-letter starts.
    - Dynamic calculation of order and renewal counts from contracts table.
    - Search by client name, dedicated number, ID, or email.
    - Sort by number of orders or renewals.
- **Contract Management**:
    - Add, edit, delete contracts with auto-generated codes (e.g., `MS25A0103`, based on category, year, dedicated number, and order count).
    - Searchable dropdowns for client and project selection using AsyncSelect with backend filtering.
    - Multi-field search across contract name, client, job note, and location, with debounce optimization (300ms).
    - Filtering by status (e.g., Active, Pending, Expiring Soon, Expired) and category (e.g., SVR, DSS, EMB, Medical).
    - Multi-column sorting (up to 2 columns) with shift-key support for adding secondary sorts.
    - Movable and removable columns using drag-and-drop (@hello-pangea/dnd) for customizable views.
    - View all contract fields in a details modal.
    - Renew contracts by searching existing contracts and creating new ones with updated dates and job notes.
    - Support for renewal tracking via previous_contract field. (not apply to the old data)
- **Project Management**:
    - View a paginated list of projects with associated clients, users, and contracts.
    - Backend search functionality by project name.
    - Each project card includes a link to view related contracts.
- **Maintenance Records** (Developing)：
    - Track maintenance requests and records, combining different statuses (e.g., New, Pending, In Progress, Closed).
    - Full CRUD operations with form for creating/editing requests.
    - Advanced filtering by status, search across multiple fields (e.g., service_code, client_name), and multi-column sorting (up to 2 columns).
    - Pagination (50 items per page) and customizable columns (movable/removable via drag-and-drop).
    - Radio button groups for categorical fields (e.g., service_type, product_type).
    - The layout, backend, and database have been completed. Other features, such as frontend, full authentication and integrated notifications, are still pending implementation.
- **Settings Page**：
    - Allows admins to approve pending user registrations via a list with approve/reject actions.
    - Enables users to change passwords with validation (e.g., match confirmation, minimum length).
    - Uses JWT decoding for user role checks and secure API calls.
- **Email Notification**：
    - Review page for expiring contracts, with pre-selection of un-renewed ones and checkbox exclusions.
    - Email preview modal showing formatted content (e.g., table with columns like Contract ID, Client Name, End Date).
    - Sends professional emails via Nodemailer with dynamic subject lines (e.g., "Maintenance contract reminder (August 2025)").
- **User Authentication**:
    - Login/register with email and password.
    - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Search Bar**: Reusable component with real-time feedback (300ms debounce) and clear button.
- **Column Customization**: Filter and reorder table columns for personalized views.

    2. Setup/ restore code
        - cd /var/www/SysTrack
        - git clone/ git pull
    3. Transfer/ restore database
        - use pgadmin4 backup database in plain text
        - scp 'C:\Users\<your-username>\Downloads\backup' user@192.168.0.153:/var/www/SysTrack
        - Apply backup. psql -U systrack_user systrack_prod -f /var/www/SysTrack/backup;

            3. npm run build

        -Backend
            1. cd../backend
            2. pm2 restart systrack-api

        - Nginx
            -sudo systemctl restart nginx (if needed)

## Future Enhancements

- **Immediate Tasks**:
    - Add better form validation and duplication checks
    - Maintenance modules including frontend, validation.
    - Fix JWT verification issues: Currently, it attempts to refresh with expired tokens (rejected and logged in console). Implement a proper refresh token mechanism for secure, long-lived sessions (e.g., using separate access and refresh tokens stored securely).
    - Allow users to adjust the settings of Expiring Soon contracts
        - A quick solution is adjust the '3 months' to '6 months' at backend/routes/contracts.js
    - Prevent send too many email by nodemailer. Notify users which cases are sent. 
    - Auto backup Database
    - Stop users from create accounts with same email. no validation check accross pending and users table currently.
- **Long-Term**:
    - Refactor for reusability: Components like pagination in contract page and search bar are not reused; create shared components in `common/` folder to avoid duplication across modules (e.g., a universal Pagination.js and SearchBar.js).
    - Informative DashBoard (Active + Pending contracts per month, non-closed maintenace records)
    - Implement role-based access (e.g., admin-only deletes)
    - Export to .xlsx/ .csv function of maintenance Recrods
    - Security improvements (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting)
    - Cloud deployment and automated backups
    - Linking with jobnote
    - E Form for maintenance
